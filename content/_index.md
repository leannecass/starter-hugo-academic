        **The impact of weather shocks on exports**\
        \[[Ergs and Equilbrium Podcast Episode](https://ergsandequilibrium.ca/2023/01/12/episode-7-weather-and-international-trade/)\]

          - *Abstract:* Previous research suggests that weather shocks negatively impact exports; however, we know relatively little about the extent to which these impacts are capturing a particularly sensitivity of exports or simply the impact on economic productivity through the lens of trade data. This paper brings together recent developments from the international trade and climate econometrics to investigate whether exports are particularly sensitive to weather shocks compared to sales in the domestic market. In contrast to previous empirical papers that study the impact of weather shocks on international trade, I use an empirical approach that includes domestic trade flows and controls robustly for multilateral resistance parameters. I find that both manufacturing and agricultural exports are sensitive to weather shocks, but in different ways. Agricultural exports are sensitive to increases in annual mean temperature, while manufacturing exports are sensitive to extreme heat days. Moreover, I provide some evidence that suggests that this sensitivity of exports to weather shocks is larger when existing trade barriers between the exporter and importer are large. Economists usually conceptualize the macroeconomic damages of climate change as productivity impacts, but these results provide some evidence that weather and potentially climate change can have economically significant impacts beyond the point of production. In particular, the results of this paper suggest that weather and climate shocks propagate unequally through supply chains, such that buyers that are more remote are more impacted by the shock.

        **The role of trade openness in the temperature-growth relationship**

          - *Summary:* This paper uses a reduced-form empirical model to test the common hypothesis that trade openness can help countries to adapt to climate change. I construct an instrument for trade openness in a manner consistent with international trade theory, and use this instrument in an empirical model of GDP per capita growth. The results provide minimal evidence that historically trade openness has helped to mitigate the negative impact of temperature shocks on economic growth.
